### Top 10 Songs on YouTube vs. Spotify:
- Most viewed song on YouTube: "Despacito" (1.5e10 views)
- Most streamed song on Spotify: "Closer" (5e9 streams)
These charts highlight that the top songs on YouTube and Spotify are different. While "Despacito" dominates YouTube in terms of views, "Closer" leads Spotify in streams.
