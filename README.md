## ðŸŽ§ðŸ“Š Spotify & YouTube Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

In this project, I applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Spotify & Youtube data. 

### ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

#### Engagement Metrics Analysis: 
- I analyzed the correlation between engagement metrics: views, likes, and comments.
- **Findings**: As the number of views increases, the number of likes and comments also increases. Likewise, as the number of likes increases, comments also increases as expected.
  
#### Audio Metrics Analysis: 
- I explored the relationships between audio metrics like danceability, energy, loudness, valance, and instrumentalness.
**Findings**:
- Strong positive correlation:
There is a strong positive correlation between Energy and Loudness meaning that songs with higher energy tend to be louder or vice versa.
There is also a strong positive correlation between Danceability and Valence which means that songs that are suitable for dancing express more positive emotions.
- Strong negative correlation:
There is a strong negative correlation between Acousticness and Energy meaning that acoustic songs tend to be less energetic.
There is also a strong negative correlation between Acousticness and Loudness meaning that acoustic songs tend to be less loud.r.
  
#### Song Distribution Analysis: 
- I examined the distribution of songs by album type (album, single, compilation).
- **Findings**: 72% of songs were released as albums, 24% as singles.

#### Top 10 Songs on YouTube vs. Spotify:
- Most viewed song on YouTube: "Despacito" (1.5e10 views)
- Most streamed song on Spotify: "Closer" (5e9 streams)

### ðŸŽ¯ Summary

This analysis provides valuable insights for artists, music producers, and marketing teams. The relationships between engagement and audio features can help guide strategic decisions.
